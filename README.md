Abstract : An all-around health platform presented here in the proposal to help the users identify potential health conditions, access relevant advice on medication, and, accordingly, manage their overall well-being effectively. This platform applies machine learning algorithms that help adequately predict the chances of diseases, given when users report symptoms. 

The patient portal will also be provided- administered as a user-friendly point of access for secure medical history storage, medication tracking, personalized reminders, and health goal management. This site further empowers user engagement as well as improves medication adherence with functionalities that track intake of medication and patterns of adherence.

 It also integrates local pharmacies to check medication availability. The integration of both functionalities should enable people to take a more active role in healthcare, which might lead to improved medication adherence and outcomes generally in healthcare.
